### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
In this lesson we used basic Javascript commands via cloud9. We added javascript code to our tax calculator in order to estimate how much income tax a person has to pay and to determine under which tax bracket they fall under, percentage wise. In addition to estimating taxable income, we also estimated based on filing status such as single, married, married filing jointly, etc.
